## Quiz 4
### Question 7
For this question, I selected the wrong data types because I was confusing Javascript with other languages. In javascript, the data types are object, symbol, null, undefined, number, string and boolean. Javascript does not include separate data types for integers and floating point numbers, nor does it include a character data type like Java does. Those three (integers, floating point, and character) are the incorrect answers that I put on question number 7.

### Question 8
I got this questio wrong because I failed to remember proper naming conventions for variables declared with the const keyword. In javascript, convention dictates that variables declared with the let or var keyword are named in lowerCamelCase, where the first letter of the name is lowercase, and the first letter of every subsequent word is capitalized. However, const variables are declared with a different convention, in which the whole name is in caps, with underscores separating the words, such as "NUM_ONE." Since the question specifically asks for the MOST correct answer, `const PI = 3.14;` is more correct than `const pi = 3.14;`.
